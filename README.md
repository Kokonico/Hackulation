# Hackulation
> A hacked-together simulation!

## What is this?
 This is a powder-toy-esque simulation that I made in Python, it's constantly being worked on, mostly by me in my spare time :P
 
## Features
- [x] solid blocks
- [x] liquid physics (WIP)
- [ ] gas physics
- [ ] fire physics
- [ ] entities and living things

## How to run
This project is nowhere near ready for usage, so you will be underwhelmed.
You can still run an experimental world by running the `test_world.py` file.

### Controls
- `WASD` to move the cursor
- `b` to place a block
- `d` to delete a block
- `l` to spawn 100 ml of liquid
- `space` to tick the simulation, hold it down to tick multiple times

## How to contribute
You can contribute by forking this repository and making a pull request with your changes!
